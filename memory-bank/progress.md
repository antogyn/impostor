# Progress: Impostor Game

## Current Status
The project has been converted to a monorepo structure using npm workspaces. The previously separate front-end and back-end repositories have been combined into a single repository with a packages directory containing backend, frontend, and shared packages. The basic game mechanics are in place, but the project has not yet been deployed or thoroughly tested.

## What Works

### Project Structure
- ✅ Monorepo setup with npm workspaces
- ✅ Shared types package for cross-package type sharing
- ✅ Package-specific configurations
- ✅ Root-level scripts for managing all packages

### Back-end
- ✅ Basic project structure and configuration
- ✅ tRPC API setup with router and procedures
- ✅ Room creation and management
- ✅ Player joining and leaving
- ✅ Game start and role assignment
- ✅ Game restart functionality
- ✅ Game counter tracking
- ✅ Player kicking functionality
- ✅ Join in-progress games
- ✅ Deno KV integration for state storage
- ✅ Automatic deletion of inactive rooms after 3 hours using Deno KV's TTL feature
- ✅ Pusher integration for real-time updates
- ✅ Environment variable support via .env files
- ✅ Documentation

### Front-end
- ✅ SolidJS project setup with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- ✅ tRPC client integration
- ✅ Pusher client integration
- ✅ State management with SolidJS stores
- ✅ UI components for all game screens
- ✅ Room creation and joining
- ✅ Lobby functionality
- ✅ Game screen with role reveal
- ✅ Game restart functionality
- ✅ Game counter display
- ✅ Support for players joining in-progress games
- ✅ QR code generation for room sharing
- ✅ QR code scanning for easy room joining
- ✅ Toast notifications for user feedback
- ✅ Modal component for displaying QR codes and scanner
- ✅ Internationalization (i18n) with English and French language support
- ✅ Language selector component
- ✅ Automatic language detection based on browser settings
- ✅ Improved button styling for better usability
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Documentation

## What's Left to Build

### Back-end
- ❌ Comprehensive testing
- ❌ Error handling improvements
- ❌ Logging and monitoring
- ❌ Rate limiting and security enhancements
- ❌ Deployment to Deno Deploy
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline

### Front-end
- ❌ Comprehensive testing
- ❌ Error handling improvements
- ❌ Loading states and animations
- ❌ Accessibility improvements
- ❌ SEO optimization
- ❌ Deployment to a static hosting service
- ❌ CI/CD pipeline

### General
- ❌ End-to-end testing
- ❌ Performance testing
- ❌ Security audit
- ❌ Documentation improvements
- ❌ User feedback collection and analysis

## Known Issues
- No comprehensive error handling for network failures
- No recovery mechanism for disconnected clients
- Limited testing of real-time functionality
- No validation for room IDs when joining (could be any string)
- No limit on the number of players in a room
- No timeout for inactive players
- No persistent storage for game history

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- **Monorepo Structure**: Using a monorepo with npm workspaces to simplify dependency management and code sharing between packages.
- **Shared Types Package**: Created a shared package for common types to ensure consistency between frontend and backend.
- **Deno for Back-end**: Chosen for its modern features, built-in TypeScript support, and security model.
- **SolidJS for Front-end**: Selected for its performance, small bundle size, and reactive programming model.
- **tRPC for API**: Chosen for end-to-end type safety and simplified API development.
- **Pusher for Real-time**: Selected due to Deno Deploy's lack of WebSocket support.

### Adjustments and Refinements
- **Environment Variables**: Added support for .env files in the back-end to simplify local development.
- **Component Structure**: Refined the component structure to promote reusability and maintainability.
- **State Management**: Implemented a centralized store for front-end state management.
- **Error Handling**: Identified the need for more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.

### Future Considerations
- **Testing Strategy**: Need to develop a comprehensive testing strategy for all packages in the monorepo.
- **Deployment Strategy**: Need to establish a deployment pipeline for the monorepo that handles both backend and frontend.
- **Monorepo CI/CD**: Set up CI/CD workflows that can build and test all packages efficiently.
- **Scaling Considerations**: May need to evaluate Deno KV's performance under load and consider alternatives if necessary.
- **Feature Expansion**: Consider adding user accounts, chat functionality, and more sophisticated game mechanics.
