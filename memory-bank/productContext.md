## How It Works

### Room Creation and Management
1. A player creates a room and becomes the host
2. The host receives a unique room ID to share with others
3. Other players join using this room ID
4. The host can kick players if needed
5. When enough players have joined (minimum 3), the host can start the game

### Game Mechanics
1. When the game starts, one player is randomly assigned as the impostor
2. Players can see their own role but not others'
3. The impostor tries to blend in while the crewmates try to identify the impostor
4. The game continues until the impostor is identified or the impostor successfully deceives everyone
